/** \page keyboard Sun Type 5c Keyboard
 *
 *  At first sight, the Type 5c has a few differences in layout from a
 *  &ldquo;standard&rdquo; US keyboard. The most effectual is the Control key
 *  above the left Shift (with Caps Lock instead below). Meta keys are next to
 *  the space bar rather than Alt. The Menu key is Compose (and has an LED),
 *  and there is no right Control key. The placement of keys for Esc, grave,
 *  backspace, and backslash is altered. Additionally, the placement of LED
 *  indicators is on the keys themselves. Moreover, there are 16 extra keys at
 *  the periphery of the layout (the blank key is traditionally for recording
 *  keyboard macros).

 *
 *  According to the <a href="http://sparc.org/standards/KBD.ps.Z">specification</a>,
 *  the keyboard speaks CS8 serial using inverted TTL logic at 1200 baud full
 *  duplex. This is done over an 8-pin mini-DIN connector. Almost all
 *  communication uses a single byte, and there are only a handful of commands
 *  from the system to the keyboard. The keyboard runs at 5VDC and draws a
 *  maximum of 150mA of current.
 *
 *  While the female mini-DIN connector is easy to come by, most AVR chips do
 *  not have a UART with native inverted logic support. It is much easier
 *  simply to use a dedicated inverter chip (or even a couple of RTL
 *  inverters) than to write a negative logic software UART.

 *
 *  Although the specification indicates that the keyboard hardware should
 *  support N-key rollover (i.e., all key depressions and releases correctly
 *  detected in any sequence regardless of how many keys are being depressed),
 *  in informal tests, keypresses are not often registered when depressing
 *  many keys next to each other. Nevertheless, it is possible to send at
 *  least 10 keypresses successfully; thus, the adapter will be able to
 *  accomodate 10 keys before sending rollover (feel free to change this in
 *  case of polydactyly).
