/** \mainpage Sun Type 5c Keyboard Adapter
 *
 *  \section Sec_Source Source Code
 *
 *  The latest source code for this project is available at
 *  <a href=http://github.com/abbaad/Sun5c>http://github.com/abbaad/Sun5c</a>.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Compat Project Compatibility:
 *
 *  The following list indicates what microcontrollers are compatible with
 *  this project.
 *
 *  - Series 7 USB AVRs (AT90USBxxx7)
 *  - Series 6 USB AVRs (AT90USBxxx6)
 *  - Series 4 USB AVRs (ATMEGAxxU4)
 *  - Series 2 USB AVRs (AT90USBxx2, ATMEGAxxU2)
 *
 *  Although this project has been written and tested for use with the Sun
 *  Type 5c Keyboard (model number 3201234-02) the code should work other
 *  versions as well (probably also the Type 4 keyboard).
 *
 *  \section Sec_Info USB Information:

 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  USB keyboard adapter for Sun Type 5c keyboard. The old Sun Type 5c keyboard
 *  is a common favorite among enthusiasts. Unfortunately, the old-style
 *  mini-DIN serial port is absent on modern PCs. Fortunately, however, the
 *  hardware is simple enough to interface with a microcontroller, and AVR has
 *  a good selection of microcontrollers with native USB support. The goal of
 *  this project is to provide an adapter for the Sun keyboard which will
 *  implement a USB HID keyboard device using the basic USB HID drivers in all modern
 *  OSes (i.e. no special drivers required). It is boot protocol compatible, and thus
 *  works under compatible BIOS as if it was a native keyboard (e.g. PS/2).
 *
 *  On start-up the system will automatically enumerate and function as a keyboard
 *  when the USB connection to a host is present. All special keys will
 *  function as intended except the Macro key which has no HID counterpart.
